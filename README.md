# Description

SimChemistry for Windows is a project dating back to the 1990s (with C++ style to match). The
idea was that it allowed users to set up and then run live molecular dynamics simulations on
screen, to better understand physical and chemical principles that emerge from
microscopic behaviour.

Although the code is pretty much obsolete, it has some heavily commented algorithms which may
still be of interest. It features both event-based simulation (e.g. when molecules are modelled
as hard 2D discs which collide instantaneously), and soft force-based motion.

As well as molecules, it includes pistons (which squeeze molecules), walls to contain them,
and monitor regions to measure properties. You can also add annotations.

Finally, scripts can be recorded and replayed to provide repeatable demonstrations, for
teaching.

This project was previously available at http://www.simchemistry.co.uk, but I may not renew
that domain again, hence it is now here. However, it is not maintained.

You are welcome to use the source code in your own programs. See code/LICENCE_README.txt
for details.
