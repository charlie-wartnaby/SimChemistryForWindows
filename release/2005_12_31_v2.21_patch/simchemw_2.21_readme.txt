Simchemistry for Windows v2.21 release

This is an experimental release for evaluation by a university.

The changes are as follows:

o changed code architecture so that the random number generator
  static data is now associated with a simulation, not the program
  overall. This is so that if two or more simulations are loaded,
  they do not affect each other's random number generation.

o Added option in "System Properties" dialogue to set the random
  number generator to a value. Doing so will be recorded in the
  script history like this:
  
    set_rand_seed 56;

  -- this can be added manually to existing scripts after the
  "begin_history;" line and before anything starts moving.

o That new setting will reset the random number generator to the
  specified value (zero is the default which should produce
  the same initial behaviour as before). This makes the script
  deterministic from that point on, in that all randomly-based
  angles and speeds will be chosen identically every time the
  script is executed (barring user intervention or fast forwarding).

o Updated online help for "system properties" dialogue to talk 
  about this.

This has been subject to limited informal testing.

To install, replace your existing simchemw.exe and .hlp with the
files provided.
